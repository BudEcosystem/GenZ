## Introduction üéâ

Welcome to **GenZ**, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on the foundation of Meta's open-source Llama V2 13B parameter model. At Bud Ecosystem, we believe in the power of open-source collaboration to drive the advancement of technology at an accelerated pace. Our vision is to democratize access to fine-tuned LLMs, and to that end, we will be releasing a series of models across different parameter counts (7B, 13B, and 70B) and quantizations (32-bit and 4-bit) for the open-source community to use, enhance, and build upon. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/BudEcosystem/GenZ/blob/main/assets/MTBench_CompareChart_28July2023.png" width="500"></p>

The smaller quantization version of our models makes them more accessible, enabling their use even on personal computers. This opens up a world of possibilities for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to experiment with these models and contribute to the collective advancement of language model technology. 

GenZ isn't just a powerful text generator‚Äîit's a sophisticated AI assistant, capable of understanding and responding to user prompts with high-quality responses. We've taken the robust capabilities of Llama V2 and fine-tuned them to offer a more user-focused experience. Whether you're seeking informative responses or engaging interactions, GenZ is designed to deliver.

And this isn't the end. It's just the beginning of a journey towards creating more advanced, more efficient, and more accessible language models. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey. üöÄ
